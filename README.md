# HTML_projects
bricks-and-sand
build websites ground up, inspired by the way a frame of a building is put up and thats ofcourse the fundamental role of html.
In this project, I shall be using html to come up with basic structures of various websites as I wait for the time I shall actually learn this in ALX.
Meanwhile, the project is opensourced with an MIT License and I welcome any contributors to it. Thank you.
