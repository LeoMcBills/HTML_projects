# HTML_projects

bricks-and-sand
    build websites ground up, inspired by the way a frame of a building is put up and that's of course the fundamental role of HTML.
    In this project, I shall be using HTML to come up with basic structures of various websites as I wait for the time I shall actually learn this in ALX.
    Meanwhile, the project is open-sourced under an MIT License and I welcome any contributors to it. Thank you.
